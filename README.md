# Base node

Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users onchain. It's built on Optimismâ€™s open-source [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/).

This repository contains the relevant Docker builds to run your own node on the Base network.

### Hardware requirements

We recommend you have this configuration to run a node:

- 8-Core CPU
- at least 16 GB RAM
- an SSD drive with at least 2.5 TB free

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter problems with your node, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/base-org/node/issues/new/choose) or reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/buildonbase):

- Once you've joined, in the Discord app go to `server menu` > `Linked Roles` > `connect GitHub` and connect your GitHub account so you can gain access to our developer channels
- Report your issue in `#ðŸ›Ÿ|node-support`

### Supported networks

| Ethereum Network | Status |
|------------------| ------ |
| Goerli testnet   | âœ…     |
| Sepolia testnet  | âœ…     |
| Mainnet          | âœ…     |

### Usage

1. Ensure you have an Ethereum L1 full node RPC available (not Base), and set `OP_NODE_L1_ETH_RPC` (in the `.env.*` file if using docker-compose). If running your own L1 node, it needs to be synced before Base will be able to fully sync.
2. Uncomment the line relevant to your network (`.env.sepolia`, or `.env.mainnet`) under the 2 `env_file` keys in `docker-compose.yml`.
3. Run:

```
docker compose up --build
```

4. You should now be able to `curl` your Base node:

```
curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false]}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8545
```

Note: Some L1 nodes (e.g. Erigon) do not support fetching storage proofs. You can work around this by specifying `--l1.trustrpc` when starting op-node (add it in `op-node-entrypoint` and rebuild the docker image with `docker compose build`.) Do not do this unless you fully trust the L1 node provider.


#### Persisting Data

By default, the data directory is stored in `${PROJECT_ROOT}/geth-data`. You can override this by modifying the value of
`GETH_HOST_DATA_DIR` variable in the [`.env`](./.env) file.

To load a [snapshot](#snapshots) you can extract the snapshot into the `$GETH_HOST_DATA_DIR` folder.

#### Running in single container with `supervisord`

If you'd like to run the node in a single container instead of `docker-compose`, you can use the `supervisord` entrypoint.
This is useful for running the node in a Kubernetes cluster, for example.

Note that you'll need to override some of the default configuration that assumes a multi-container environment (`OP_NODE_L2_ENGINE_RPC`) and any port conflicts (`OP_NODE_RPC_PORT`).
Example:
```
docker run --env-file .env.sepolia -e OP_NODE_L2_ENGINE_RPC=ws://localhost:8551 -e OP_NODE_RPC_PORT=7545 ghcr.io/base-org/node:latest
```

### Snapshots

You can fetch the latest snapshots via the URLs provided in the [Base docs](https://docs.base.org/guides/run-a-base-node/#snapshots).

### Syncing

Sync speed depends on your L1 node, as the majority of the chain is derived from data submitted to the L1. You can check your syncing status using the `optimism_syncStatus` RPC on the `op-node` container. Example:

```
command -v jq  &> /dev/null || { echo "jq is not installed" 1>&2 ; }
echo Latest synced block behind by: \
$((($( date +%s )-\
$( curl -s -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:7545 |
   jq -r .result.unsafe_l2.timestamp))/60)) minutes
```
